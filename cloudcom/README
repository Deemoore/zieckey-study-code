1. init
Run init_projects.sh first.

2. build and install

There are tow shell script: autoconf.sh and build_and_install.sh.
autoconf.sh: used to run the autoconf tool-chain. This script will create all Makefiles.
build_and_install.sh: used to compile all the subproject and install them.
So you can execute autoconf.sh firstly and then build_and_install.sh secondly.

At last, you can execute clean_all.sh to clean all the object files.

Anytime, you can use run_autoconf_and_build_install.sh to build and install this common library.
This script will execute autoconf.sh firstly and then build_and_install.sh secondly.
