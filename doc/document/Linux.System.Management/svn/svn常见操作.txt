Name

svn merge ¡ª Apply the differences between two sources to a working copy path.
Synopsis

svn merge sourceURL1[@N] sourceURL2[@M] [WCPATH]

svn merge -r N:M SOURCE [PATH]

Description

In the first form, the source URLs are specified at revisions N and M. These are the two sources to be compared. The revisions default to HEAD if omitted.

In the second form, SOURCE can be a URL or working copy item, in which case the corresponding URL is used. This URL, at revisions N and M, defines the two sources to be compared.

WCPATH is the working copy path that will receive the changes. If WCPATH is omitted, a default value of ¡°.¡± is assumed, unless the sources have identical basenames that match a file within ¡°.¡±: in which case, the differences will be applied to that file.

Unlike svn diff, the merge command takes the ancestry of a file into consideration when performing a merge operation. This is very important when you're merging changes from one branch into another and you've renamed a file on one branch but not the other.

Examples

Merge a branch back into the trunk (assuming that you have a working copy of the trunk, and that the branch was created in revision 250):

$ svn merge -r 250:HEAD http://svn.red-bean.com/repos/branches/my-branch
U  myproj/tiny.txt
U  myproj/thhgttg.txt
U  myproj/win.txt
U  myproj/flo.txt

If you branched at revision 23, and you want to merge changes on trunk into your branch, you could do this from inside the working copy of your branch:

$ svn merge -r 23:30 file:///tmp/repos/trunk/vendors
U  myproj/thhgttg.txt
¡­

To merge changes to a single file:

$ cd myproj
$ svn merge -r 30:31 thhgttg.txt 
U  thhgttg.txt
