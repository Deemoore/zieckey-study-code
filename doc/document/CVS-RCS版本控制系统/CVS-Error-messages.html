<h3 class="appendixsec">F.1 Partial list of error messages</h3>

<p>Here is a partial list of error messages that you may
see from <span class="sc">cvs</span>.  It is not a complete list&mdash;<span class="sc">cvs</span>
is capable of printing many, many error messages, often
with parts of them supplied by the operating system,
but the intention is to list the common and/or
potentially confusing error messages.

   <p>The messages are alphabetical, but introductory text
such as <span class="samp">cvs update: </span> is not considered in
ordering them.

   <p>In some cases the list includes messages printed by old
versions of <span class="sc">cvs</span> (partly because users may not be
sure which version of <span class="sc">cvs</span> they are using at any
particular moment). 
<!-- If we want to start retiring messages, perhaps we -->
<!-- should pick a cutoff version (for example, no more -->
<!-- messages which are specific to versions before 1.9) -->
<!-- and then move the old messages to an "old messages" -->
<!-- node rather than deleting them completely. -->

     <dl>
<!-- FIXME: What is the correct way to format a multiline -->
<!-- error message here?  Maybe @table is the wrong -->
<!-- choice?  Texinfo gurus? -->
<dt><var>file</var><code>:</code><var>line</var><code>: Assertion '</code><var>text</var><code>' failed</code><dd>The exact format of this message may vary depending on
your system.  It indicates a bug in <span class="sc">cvs</span>, which can
be handled as described in <a href="BUGS.html#BUGS">BUGS</a>.

     <br><dt><code>cvs </code><var>command</var><code>: authorization failed: server </code><var>host</var><code> rejected access</code><dd>This is a generic response when trying to connect to a
pserver server which chooses not to provide a
specific reason for denying authorization.  Check that
the username and password specified are correct and
that the <code>CVSROOT</code> specified is allowed by <span class="samp">--allow-root</span>
in <span class="file">inetd.conf</span>.  See <a href="Password-authenticated.html#Password-authenticated">Password authenticated</a>.

     <br><dt><code>cvs </code><var>command</var><code>: conflict: removed </code><var>file</var><code> was modified by second party</code><dd>This message indicates that you removed a file, and
someone else modified it.  To resolve the conflict,
first run <span class="samp">cvs add </span><var>file</var>.  If desired, look
at the other party's modification to decide whether you
still want to remove it.  If you don't want to remove
it, stop here.  If you do want to remove it, proceed
with <span class="samp">cvs remove </span><var>file</var> and commit your
removal. 
<!-- Tests conflicts2-142b* in sanity.sh test for this. -->

     <br><dt><code>cannot change permissions on temporary directory</code><dd>
     <pre class="example">          Operation not permitted
     </pre>
     <p>This message has been happening in a non-reproducible,
occasional way when we run the client/server testsuite,
both on Red Hat Linux 3.0.3 and 4.1.  We haven't been
able to figure out what causes it, nor is it known
whether it is specific to Linux (or even to this
particular machine!).  If the problem does occur on
other unices, <span class="samp">Operation not permitted</span> would be
likely to read <span class="samp">Not owner</span> or whatever the system
in question uses for the unix <code>EPERM</code> error.  If
you have any information to add, please let us know as
described in <a href="BUGS.html#BUGS">BUGS</a>.  If you experience this error
while using <span class="sc">cvs</span>, retrying the operation which
produced it should work fine. 
<!-- This has been seen in a variety of tests, including -->
<!-- multibranch-2, multibranch-5, and basic1-24-rm-rm, -->
<!-- so it doesn't seem particularly specific to any one -->
<!-- test. -->

     <br><dt><code>cvs [server aborted]: Cannot check out files into the repository itself</code><dd>The obvious cause for this message (especially for
non-client/server <span class="sc">cvs</span>) is that the <span class="sc">cvs</span> root
is, for example, <span class="file">/usr/local/cvsroot</span> and you try
to check out files when you are in a subdirectory, such
as <span class="file">/usr/local/cvsroot/test</span>.  However, there is a
more subtle cause, which is that the temporary
directory on the server is set to a subdirectory of the
root (which is also not allowed).  If this is the
problem, set the temporary directory to somewhere else,
for example <span class="file">/var/tmp</span>; see <code>TMPDIR</code> in
<a href="Environment-variables.html#Environment-variables">Environment variables</a>, for how to set the
temporary directory.

     <br><dt><code>cannot commit files as 'root'</code><dd>See <span class="samp">'root' is not allowed to commit files</span>.

     <!-- For one example see basica-1a10 in the testsuite -->
<!-- For another example, "cvs co ." on NT; see comment -->
<!-- at windows-NT/filesubr.c (expand_wild). -->
<!-- For another example, "cvs co foo/bar" where foo exists. -->
<br><dt><code>cannot open CVS/Entries for reading: No such file or directory</code><dd>This generally indicates a <span class="sc">cvs</span> internal error, and
can be handled as with other <span class="sc">cvs</span> bugs
(参阅 <a href="BUGS.html#BUGS">BUGS</a>).  Usually there is a workaround&mdash;the
exact nature of which would depend on the situation but
which hopefully could be figured out.

     <!-- This is more obscure than it might sound; it only -->
<!-- happens if you run "cvs init" from a directory which -->
<!-- contains a CVS/Root file at the start. -->
<br><dt><code>cvs [init aborted]: cannot open CVS/Root: No such file or directory</code><dd>This message is harmless.  Provided it is not
accompanied by other errors, the operation has
completed successfully.  This message should not occur
with current versions of <span class="sc">cvs</span>, but it is documented
here for the benefit of <span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.9 and older.

     <br><dt><code>cvs server: cannot open /root/.cvsignore: Permission denied</code><dt><code>cvs [server aborted]: can't chdir(/root): Permission denied</code><dd>See <a href="Connection.html#Connection">Connection</a>.

     <br><dt><code>cvs [checkout aborted]: cannot rename file </code><var>file</var><code> to CVS/,,</code><var>file</var><code>: Invalid argument</code><dd>This message has been reported as intermittently
happening with <span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.9 on Solaris 2.5.  The cause is
unknown; if you know more about what causes it, let us
know as described in <a href="BUGS.html#BUGS">BUGS</a>.

     <br><dt><code>cvs [</code><var>command</var><code> aborted]: cannot start server via rcmd</code><dd>This, unfortunately, is a rather nonspecific error
message which <span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.9 will print if you are
running the <span class="sc">cvs</span> client and it is having trouble
connecting to the server.  Current versions of <span class="sc">cvs</span>
should print a much more specific error message.  If
you get this message when you didn't mean to run the
client at all, you probably forgot to specify
<code>:local:</code>, as described in <a href="Repository.html#Repository">Repository</a>.

     <br><dt><code>ci: </code><var>file</var><code>,v: bad diff output line: Binary files - and /tmp/T2a22651 differ</code><dd><span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.9 and older will print this message
when trying to check in a binary file if
<span class="sc">rcs</span> is not correctly installed.  Re-read the
instructions that came with your <span class="sc">rcs</span> distribution
and the <span class="sc">install</span> file in the <span class="sc">cvs</span>
distribution.  Alternately, upgrade to a current
version of <span class="sc">cvs</span>, which checks in files itself
rather than via <span class="sc">rcs</span>.

     <br><dt><code>cvs checkout: could not check out </code><var>file</var><dd>With <span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.9, this can mean that the <code>co</code> program
(part of <span class="sc">rcs</span>) returned a failure.  It should be
preceded by another error message, however it has been
observed without another error message and the cause is
not well-understood.  With the current version of <span class="sc">cvs</span>,
which does not run <code>co</code>, if this message occurs
without another error message, it is definitely a <span class="sc">cvs</span>
bug (参阅 <a href="BUGS.html#BUGS">BUGS</a>). 
<!-- My current suspicion is that the RCS in the rcs (not -->
<!-- cvs/winnt/rcs57nt.zip) directory on the _Practical_ -->
<!-- CD is bad (remains to be confirmed). -->
<!-- There is also a report of something which looks -->
<!-- very similar on SGI, Irix 5.2, so I dunno. -->

     <br><dt><code>cvs [login aborted]: could not find out home directory</code><dd>This means that you need to set the environment
variables that <span class="sc">cvs</span> uses to locate your home directory. 
See the discussion of <code>HOME</code>, <code>HOMEDRIVE</code>, and <code>HOMEPATH</code> in
<a href="Environment-variables.html#Environment-variables">Environment variables</a>.

     <br><dt><code>cvs update: could not merge revision </code><var>rev</var><code> of </code><var>file</var><code>: No such file or directory</code><dd><span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.9 and older will print this message if there was
a problem finding the <code>rcsmerge</code> program.  Make
sure that it is in your <code>PATH</code>, or upgrade to a
current version of <span class="sc">cvs</span>, which does not require
an external <code>rcsmerge</code> program.

     <br><dt><code>cvs [update aborted]: could not patch </code><var>file</var><code>: No such file or directory</code><dd>This means that there was a problem finding the
<code>patch</code> program.  Make sure that it is in your
<code>PATH</code>.  Note that despite appearances the message
is <em>not</em> referring to whether it can find <var>file</var>. 
If both the client and the server are running a current
version of <span class="sc">cvs</span>, then there is no need for an
external patch program and you should not see this
message.  But if either client or server is running
<span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.9, then you need <code>patch</code>.

     <br><dt><code>cvs update: could not patch </code><var>file</var><code>; will refetch</code><dd>This means that for whatever reason the client was
unable to apply a patch that the server sent.  The
message is nothing to be concerned about, because
inability to apply the patch only slows things down and
has no effect on what <span class="sc">cvs</span> does. 
<!-- xref to update output.  Or File status? -->
<!-- Or some place else that -->
<!-- explains this whole "patch"/P/Needs Patch thing? -->

     <br><dt><code>dying gasps from </code><var>server</var><code> unexpected</code><dd>There is a known bug in the server for <span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.9.18
and older which can cause this.  For me, this was
reproducible if I used the <span class="samp">-t</span> global option.  It
was fixed by Andy Piper's 14 Nov 1997 change to
src/filesubr.c, if anyone is curious. 
If you see the message,
you probably can just retry the operation which failed,
or if you have discovered information concerning its
cause, please let us know as described in <a href="BUGS.html#BUGS">BUGS</a>.

     <br><dt><code>end of file from server (consult above messages if any)</code><dd>The most common cause for this message is if you are
using an external <code>rsh</code> program and it exited with
an error.  In this case the <code>rsh</code> program should
have printed a message, which will appear before the
above message.  For more information on setting up a
<span class="sc">cvs</span> client and server, see <a href="Remote-repositories.html#Remote-repositories">Remote repositories</a>.

     <br><dt><code>cvs [update aborted]: EOF in key in RCS file </code><var>file</var><code>,v</code><dt><code>cvs [checkout aborted]: EOF while looking for end of string in RCS file </code><var>file</var><code>,v</code><dd>This means that there is a syntax error in the given
<span class="sc">rcs</span> file.  Note that this might be true even if <span class="sc">rcs</span> can
read the file OK; <span class="sc">cvs</span> does more error checking of
errors in the RCS file.  That is why you may see this
message when upgrading from <span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.9 to <span class="sc">cvs</span>
1.10.  The likely cause for the original corruption is
hardware, the operating system, or the like.  Of
course, if you find a case in which <span class="sc">cvs</span> seems to
corrupting the file, by all means report it,
(参阅 <a href="BUGS.html#BUGS">BUGS</a>). 
There are quite a few variations of this error message,
depending on exactly where in the <span class="sc">rcs</span> file <span class="sc">cvs</span>
finds the syntax error.

     <p><a name="index-mkmodules-625"></a><br><dt><code>cvs commit: Executing 'mkmodules'</code><dd>This means that your repository is set up for a version
of <span class="sc">cvs</span> prior to <span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.8.  When using <span class="sc">cvs</span>
1.8 or later, the above message will be preceded by

     <pre class="example">          cvs commit: Rebuilding administrative file database
     </pre>
     <p>If you see both messages, the database is being rebuilt
twice, which is unnecessary but harmless.  If you wish
to avoid the duplication, and you have no versions of
<span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.7 or earlier in use, remove <code>-i mkmodules</code>
every place it appears in your <code>modules</code>
file.  For more information on the <code>modules</code> file,
see <a href="modules.html#modules">modules</a>.

     <!-- This message comes from "co", and I believe is -->
<!-- possible only with older versions of CVS which call -->
<!-- co.  The problem with being able to create the bogus -->
<!-- RCS file still exists, though (and I think maybe -->
<!-- there is a different symptom(s) now). -->
<!-- FIXME: Would be nice to have a more exact wording -->
<!-- for this message. -->
<br><dt><code>missing author</code><dd>Typically this can happen if you created an RCS file
with your username set to empty.  <span class="sc">cvs</span> will, bogusly,
create an illegal RCS file with no value for the author
field.  The solution is to make sure your username is
set to a non-empty value and re-create the RCS file. 
<!-- "make sure your username is set" is complicated in -->
<!-- and of itself, as there are the environment -->
<!-- variables the system login name, &c, and it depends -->
<!-- on the version of CVS. -->

     <br><dt><code>cvs [checkout aborted]: no such tag </code><var>tag</var><dd>This message means that <span class="sc">cvs</span> isn't familiar with
the tag <var>tag</var>.  Usually this means that you have
mistyped a tag name; however there are (relatively
obscure) cases in which <span class="sc">cvs</span> will require you to
<!-- Search sanity.sh for "no such tag" to see some of -->
<!-- the relatively obscure cases. -->
try a few other <span class="sc">cvs</span> commands involving that tag,
before you find one which will cause <span class="sc">cvs</span> to update
<a name="index-CVSROOT_002fval_002dtags-file_002c-forcing-tags-into-626"></a><a name="index-val_002dtags-file_002c-forcing-tags-into-627"></a>the <span class="file">val-tags</span> file; see discussion of val-tags in
<a href="File-permissions.html#File-permissions">File permissions</a>.  You only need to worry about
this once for a given tag; when a tag is listed in
<span class="file">val-tags</span>, it stays there.  Note that using
<span class="samp">-f</span> to not require tag matches does not override
this check; see <a href="Common-options.html#Common-options">Common options</a>.

     <br><dt><code>*PANIC* administration files missing</code><dd>This typically means that there is a directory named
<span class="sc">cvs</span> but it does not contain the administrative files
which <span class="sc">cvs</span> puts in a CVS directory.  If the problem is
that you created a CVS directory via some mechanism
other than <span class="sc">cvs</span>, then the answer is simple, use a name
other than <span class="sc">cvs</span>.  If not, it indicates a <span class="sc">cvs</span> bug
(参阅 <a href="BUGS.html#BUGS">BUGS</a>).

     <br><dt><code>rcs error: Unknown option: -x,v/</code><dd>This message will be followed by a usage message for
<span class="sc">rcs</span>.  It means that you have an old version of
<span class="sc">rcs</span> (probably supplied with your operating
system), as well as an old version of <span class="sc">cvs</span>. 
<span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.9.18 and earlier only work with <span class="sc">rcs</span> version 5 and
later; current versions of <span class="sc">cvs</span> do not run <span class="sc">rcs</span> programs. 
<!-- For more information on installing @sc{cvs}, see -->
<!-- (FIXME: where?  it depends on whether you are -->
<!-- getting binaries or sources or what). -->
<!-- The message can also say "ci error" or something -->
<!-- instead of "rcs error", I suspect. -->

     <br><dt><code>cvs [server aborted]: received broken pipe signal</code><dd>This message can be caused by a loginfo program that fails to
read all of the log information from its standard input. 
If you find it happening in any other circumstances,
please let us know as described in <a href="BUGS.html#BUGS">BUGS</a>.

     <br><dt><code>'root' is not allowed to commit files</code><dd>When committing a permanent change, <span class="sc">cvs</span> makes a log entry of
who committed the change.  If you are committing the change logged
in as "root" (not under "su" or other root-priv giving program),
<span class="sc">cvs</span> cannot determine who is actually making the change. 
As such, by default, <span class="sc">cvs</span> disallows changes to be committed by users
logged in as "root".  (You can disable this option by passing the
<code>--enable-rootcommit</code> option to <span class="file">configure</span> and recompiling <span class="sc">cvs</span>. 
On some systems this means editing the appropriate <span class="file">config.h</span> file
before building <span class="sc">cvs</span>.)

     <br><dt><code>Too many arguments!</code><dd>This message is typically printed by the <span class="file">log.pl</span>
script which is in the <span class="file">contrib</span> directory in the
<span class="sc">cvs</span> source distribution.  In some versions of
<span class="sc">cvs</span>, <span class="file">log.pl</span> has been part of the default
<span class="sc">cvs</span> installation.  The <span class="file">log.pl</span> script gets
called from the <span class="file">loginfo</span> administrative file. 
Check that the arguments passed in <span class="file">loginfo</span> match
what your version of <span class="file">log.pl</span> expects.  In
particular, the <span class="file">log.pl</span> from <span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.3 and
older expects the log file as an argument whereas the
<span class="file">log.pl</span> from <span class="sc">cvs</span> 1.5 and newer expects the
log file to be specified with a <span class="samp">-f</span> option.  Of
course, if you don't need <span class="file">log.pl</span> you can just
comment it out of <span class="file">loginfo</span>.

     <br><dt><code>cvs [update aborted]: unexpected EOF reading </code><var>file</var><code>,v</code><dd>See <span class="samp">EOF in key in RCS file</span>.

     <br><dt><code>cvs [login aborted]: unrecognized auth response from </code><var>server</var><dd>This message typically means that the server is not set
up properly.  For example, if <span class="file">inetd.conf</span> points
to a nonexistent cvs executable.  To debug it further,
find the log file which inetd writes
(<span class="file">/var/log/messages</span> or whatever inetd uses on
your system).  For details, see <a href="Connection.html#Connection">Connection</a>, and
<a href="Password-authentication-server.html#Password-authentication-server">Password authentication server</a>.

     <br><dt><code>cvs commit: Up-to-date check failed for `</code><var>file</var><code>'</code><dd>This means that someone else has committed a change to
that file since the last time that you did a <code>cvs
update</code>.  So before proceeding with your <code>cvs
commit</code> you need to <code>cvs update</code>.  <span class="sc">cvs</span> will merge
the changes that you made and the changes that the
other person made.  If it does not detect any conflicts
it will report <span class="samp">M </span><var>file</var> and you are ready
to <code>cvs commit</code>.  If it detects conflicts it will
print a message saying so, will report <span class="samp">C </span><var>file</var>,
and you need to manually resolve the
conflict.  For more details on this process see
<a href="Conflicts-example.html#Conflicts-example">Conflicts example</a>.

     <br><dt><code>Usage:	diff3 [-exEX3 [-i | -m] [-L label1 -L label3]] file1 file2 file3</code><dd>
     <pre class="example">          Only one of [exEX3] allowed
     </pre>
     <p>This indicates a problem with the installation of
<code>diff3</code> and <code>rcsmerge</code>.  Specifically
<code>rcsmerge</code> was compiled to look for GNU diff3, but
it is finding unix diff3 instead.  The exact text of
the message will vary depending on the system.  The
simplest solution is to upgrade to a current version of
<span class="sc">cvs</span>, which does not rely on external
<code>rcsmerge</code> or <code>diff3</code> programs.

     <br><dt><code>warning: unrecognized response `</code><var>text</var><code>' from cvs server</code><dd>If <var>text</var> contains a valid response (such as
<span class="samp">ok</span>) followed by an extra carriage return
character (on many systems this will cause the second
part of the message to overwrite the first part), then
it probably means that you are using the <span class="samp">:ext:</span>
access method with a version of rsh, such as most
non-unix rsh versions, which does not by default
provide a transparent data stream.  In such cases you
probably want to try <span class="samp">:server:</span> instead of
<span class="samp">:ext:</span>.  If <var>text</var> is something else, this
may signify a problem with your <span class="sc">cvs</span> server. 
Double-check your installation against the instructions
for setting up the <span class="sc">cvs</span> server. 
<!-- FIXCVS: should be printing CR as \r or \015 or some -->
<!-- such, probably. -->

     <br><dt><code>cvs commit: [</code><var>time</var><code>] waiting for </code><var>user</var><code>'s lock in </code><var>directory</var><dd>This is a normal message, not an error.  See
<a href="Concurrency.html#Concurrency">Concurrency</a>, for more details.

     <br><dt><code>cvs commit: warning: editor session failed</code><dd><a name="index-Exit-status_002c-of-editor-628"></a>This means that the editor which <span class="sc">cvs</span> is using exits with a nonzero
